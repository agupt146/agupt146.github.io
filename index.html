<p class="lead mb-4"> Hello, I'm Arya Gupta, a current freshman at UC Riverside, where I am navigating the exciting terrain of academia while actively contributing to campus life. As a prospective business major, my journey here has been shaped by a commitment to leadership, community engagement, and a passion for making a positive impact.<br><br>
  In my role as a Marketing Intern at local tutoring company Stem Springs in Pleasanton, CA, I was pivotal in shaping the company's online presence. I spearheaded the development of a robust social media profile and created compelling content that not only engaged the audience but also broadened the company's reach. I conceptualized and designed the company's website, logo, and promotional materials, crafting a modern and cohesive brand image. I also communicated with students and parents to make sure their needs were being met, as well as kept track of student enrollment and other metrics. This experience immersed me in the fast-paced world of marketing, where adaptability and creativity are essential. Transitioning from the digital landscape to a more hands-on role, I embraced the position of a Summer Camp Leader at Down On the Farm, organized by the Golden Gate Area Council in Dublin, CA. Here, I led and oversaw a group of energetic and diverse campers, fostering a positive and engaging environment. My responsibilities included planning and executing a variety of educational and recreational activities daily, emphasizing holistic development. Inspiring a motivational atmosphere, I dedicated myself to ensuring each camper's enjoyment and growth throughout the camp experience. One of my most fulfilling experiences has been serving as Co-President for "Make Haste for Food Waste," a community initiative in Dublin, CA. In this role, I led a strategic waste reduction campaign within the school, placing designated trash bins strategically to redirect surplus food to local charitable organizations. Orchestrating the donation of surplus food resources significantly increased contributions to local food drives, pantries, and churches, amplifying the positive impact on community welfare. I am proud to be able to say that I played a significant part in establishing and leading a dedicated club, focused on fostering a sustainable mindset among students and contributing to a broader cultural shift toward conscientious resource management within the school community. My involvement extends beyond professional endeavors to community service and cultural engagement. Volunteering with the California Student Federation and Aqua, I transcribed documents, made cards for the elderly, and created baskets for underserved populations, emphasizing my commitment to making a difference beyond the confines of the workplace.<br><br>
  As I continue my academic journey at UC Riverside, I am excited about the opportunities for growth, learning, and contributing to the vibrant community here. My experiences have not only equipped me with valuable skills but also instilled in me a deep appreciation for the power of community engagement and leadership. I look forward to embracing new challenges, forging meaningful connections, and leaving a lasting impact on both my academic and extracurricular pursuits.
